# dsp
Digital signal processing playground

## GUI
- load in wave files
- plot amplitude and spectral graphs
- left, right arrow keys cycle through wave file
- click on wave graph to select start and endpoints of a new slice
- write new slice to file

## Slice
- read a portion or entire wav file into a buffer
- speed up the buffer by removing frames
- slow down the buffer by repeting frames
- reverse the buffer by writing it backwards
- write to a new wave file
