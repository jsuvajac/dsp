Digital signal processing playground

## GUI
- select start and endpoint of a new slice
- write new slice to file

## Slice
- read a portion or entire wav file into a buffer
- speed up the buffer by removing frames
- slow down the buffer by repeting frames
- reverse the buffer by writing it backwards
- write to a new wave file
- plot amplitude and spectral graphs
