# dsp
Digital signal processing playground

- Attempting to setup an asio-based c++ audio environment to do dsp in real time.

## Slice
- read a portion or entire wav file into a buffer
- speed up the buffer by removing frames
- slow down the buffer by repeting frames
- reverse the buffer by writing it backwards
- write to a new wave file
- plot amplitude and spectral graphs
